# 🧠 Deep Learning Practicals (LP-IV)

This repository contains implementations of core **Deep Learning** models and concepts using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, developed as part of the **LP-IV (Deep Learning)** practical course.  
Each experiment demonstrates a different neural network architecture — from basic feedforward networks to advanced transfer learning techniques.
